BYU CS 260 Application

##Overall Description
I will create a calander and people managment system that can be easily extended to become a task and project managment system. The inspiration behind this project is Area Book Planner (now know as the Preach My Gospel App). It will have a simple and easy to use interface. (And maybe eventually hook into the Google Calender API).


##Web Technologies
###HTML
I will use HTML for the elements of the website.

###CSS
I will use CSS to style the website.

###Javascript
I will use Javascript for interactivity on the website. For example, manipulating the DOM to show and hide content, executing functions and updating data.

###Web Service
I will use web Services to communicate between the client and the server. I will use it to update calander events, people information, and retrieve this information from the server.

###Authentication
I will use Authentication to protect the users data behind a username and password combination. (And maybe eventually Passkeys). 

###Database Persistence
I will use MongoDB as my database and S3 as my storage solution. This will allows me to store my people and calander data. 

###Web Sockets
I will use Web Sockets to enable functionality of inviting other users to an event and checking other users calanders in real time to provide intelligent meeting scheduling. 

###Web Framework
I thought about using Angular and React for my front end framework and decided on using React, mainly because it was required by the class. It will help me create custom web components and let me leverage Javascript to increase user reactivity.
